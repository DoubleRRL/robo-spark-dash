# ðŸš— Robotaxi App Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Vehicles Going Outside Boundary
- **Problem**: Vehicles were appearing outside the Compton polygon boundary, creating unrealistic routes.
- **Fix**: Implemented a proper point-in-polygon check using the ray casting algorithm.
- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/utils/vehicleRouting.ts`: Added `isPointInCompton()` and `constrainToCompton()` functions
  - `realisticVehicleSimulator.cjs`: Updated to use polygon boundary check

### 2. Routes Cutting Through Buildings
- **Problem**: Routes were straight lines that cut through buildings instead of following roads.
- **Fix**: 
  - Improved route generation to use Google Maps Directions API for realistic road-following routes
  - Added fallback curved routes when Google Maps API is unavailable
  - Ensured all route points stay within the Compton polygon boundary
- **Files Modified**:
  - `realisticVehicleSimulator.cjs`: Enhanced `createRealisticRoute()` function
  - `src/components/GoogleMapComponent.tsx`: Updated route generation

### 3. App Crashing When Selecting Vehicles
- **Problem**: Selecting vehicles caused the app to crash with `TypeError: control2.remove is not a function`.
- **Fix**: Fixed route control cleanup logic to handle both `remove()` and `removeFrom()` methods.
- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/components/LeafletMapComponent.tsx`: Updated cleanup logic for `routeControlRef.current`

### 4. Missing Vehicle Model Names
- **Problem**: Vehicle model names (Cybertruck, Model Y, Model X) were not showing in the Fleet Vehicles panel.
- **Fix**: Updated the `getVehicleDisplayName` function to use the `type` field from socket data.
- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`: Fixed vehicle type display logic

## Technical Details

### Point-in-Polygon Check
We implemented the ray casting algorithm to determine if a point is inside the Compton polygon:

```javascript
function isPointInCompton(lat, lng) {
  let inside = false;
  for (let i = 0, j = COMPTON_POLYGON.length - 1; i < COMPTON_POLYGON.length; j = i++) {
    const xi = COMPTON_POLYGON[i][1], yi = COMPTON_POLYGON[i][0];
    const xj = COMPTON_POLYGON[j][1], yj = COMPTON_POLYGON[j][0];
    
    const intersect = ((yi > lat) !== (yj > lat))
        && (lng < (xj - xi) * (lat - yi) / (yj - yi) + xi);
    if (intersect) inside = !inside;
  }
  
  return inside;
}
```

### Route Constraint Logic
When a point is outside the polygon, we find the closest known safe point within Compton:

```javascript
function constrainToCompton(lat, lng) {
  if (isPointInCompton(lat, lng)) {
    return { lat, lng };
  }
  
  let closestPoint = VEHICLE_START_LOCATIONS[0];
  let minDistance = Number.MAX_VALUE;
  
  for (const location of VEHICLE_START_LOCATIONS) {
    if (isPointInCompton(location.lat, location.lng)) {
      const distance = Math.sqrt(
        Math.pow(location.lat - lat, 2) + 
        Math.pow(location.lng - lng, 2)
      );
      
      if (distance < minDistance) {
        minDistance = distance;
        closestPoint = location;
      }
    }
  }
  
  return { lat: closestPoint.lat, lng: closestPoint.lng };
}
```

## Testing
1. Start all services: `npm run dev:all`
2. Or run separately:
   - Backend: `npm run dev:backend`
   - Frontend: `npm run dev:frontend`
   - Simulator: `npm run dev:simulator`
3. Open the app in your browser at `http://localhost:8080`

You should now see:
- All vehicles staying within the Compton boundary
- Routes following roads instead of cutting through buildings
- Vehicle model names displayed correctly
- No crashes when selecting vehicles
