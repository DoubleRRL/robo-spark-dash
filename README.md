# Robo-Spark Dashboard

A comprehensive autonomous vehicle fleet management dashboard for Tesla robotaxis operating in Compton, CA. Features realistic routing, diagnostics, and fleet management capabilities.

## üöó Features

### Realistic Vehicle Routing
- **OSRM Integration**: Uses Open Source Routing Machine for real street-based navigation
- **Compton Boundary**: Vehicles constrained to Compton, CA service area
- **Realistic Movement**: Vehicles follow actual streets, not random paths
- **Route Visualization**: Click on vehicles to see their planned routes on the map

### Vehicle Status Management
- **Status Types**: 
  - `available` - Ready for new trips
  - `en-route` - Currently driving to pickup/destination
  - `charging` - At charging station
  - `en-route-to-charging` - Heading to charging station
- **Intelligent Trip Assignment**: Automatically assigns nearest available vehicle to ride requests
- **Charging Management**: Low battery vehicles automatically routed to nearest charging station

### Comprehensive Diagnostics
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Battery health, sensor status, mechanical systems
- **Predictive Maintenance**: Identifies issues before they become critical
- **Remote Troubleshooting**: Determines what can be fixed remotely vs. requiring technician
- **Health Scoring**: Overall vehicle health percentage (0-100%)

### Fleet Analytics
- **Real-time Metrics**: Active vehicles, average wait time, trip completion rates
- **Performance Tracking**: Efficiency scores, harsh driving events, average speeds
- **Revenue Calculation**: Realistic fares based on distance ($2.69 - $14.20 range)

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
